<field name="descriptions">Greetings Ian,

Fengping Hu has requested to become a Grid Admin for the following domain(s)&amp;#58; purdue.edu
Can you please confirm that he is authorized to make such a request?  This can be done by either informing
me (adeximo@iu.edu) directly with a confirmation email signed with your DOEGrid cert regarding Fengping&amp;#39;s
request.  Another way is to log into OIM and accessing the ticket through the ticket link.  Then place an
update response into the ticket and your entry will automatically append your DN.  Your assistance is greatly
appreciated.

Thanks,

<field name="descriptions">Dear OSG PKI operations,

I ##Fengping Hu## would like to be a Grid administrator for ##Purdue##. 

I would like to be authorized to request and approve OSG certificates for the following name space(s)&amp;#58;
*.rcac.purdue.edu

1. As the Grid Administrator, I have read and understand the responsibilities and tasks assigned to a Grid Administrator as laid out in the Trusted Agent Agreement&amp;#58; https&amp;#58;//twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Operations/OSGPKIAgreements/DigiCert-OSG_Agent_Agreement.pdf

2. I agree that as Grid Administrator I will only submit and approve Service certificates for the FQDNs listed above.

3. I understand that I am responsible for the revocation of certificates that are suspected of being compromised or issued in violation of the OSG policies.

Thank you.</field>
